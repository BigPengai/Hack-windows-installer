# Hack Windows Installer

A Windows installer for [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack).

## Usage

- Download from [Releases](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/releases/)
- Run HackWindowsInstaller.exe
- Follow the instructions

## Silent Installation

To install silently, use the following command:

 ``start /wait HackWindowsInstaller.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /CLOSEAPPLICATIONS /NORESTARTAPPLICATIONS``

To remove it silently: 

 ``C:\Program Files\Hack Windows Installer\unins000.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART``

## Troubleshooting

The installer always creates a log file as C:\Users\ (Username) \AppData\Local\Temp\Setup Log (Year-Month-Day) #<XXX>.txt.

If you are using EMET: If the "Only trusted fonts" option is activated, you need to declare Hack as trusted or it will not be usable.
