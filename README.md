# Hack Windows Installer

A Windows installer for the [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack) typeface.

While it might seem like overkill to use a Windows installer for fonts, there is good reason for this on the Windows platform. A number of things can go wrong when one tries to install or update frequently updated fonts manually (see [issue #152](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/issues/152) and [issue #129](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/issues/129) in the [Hack repository](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/)). 

This installer addresses most of the [commonly obeserved issues](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/blob/master/FontInstallationIssues.md).


## Usage

- Download `HackWindowsInstaller.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/releases/latest)
- Double click `HackWindowsInstaller.exe`
- Follow the installation instructions


## Installer Source

You may review the comment annotated installer source in [HackWindowsInstaller.iss](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/blob/master/src/HackWindowsInstaller.iss).

To build this setup yourself, download the most recent ANSI (not Unicode) version of [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php). Install it and activate the option to install the [Inno Setup Preprocessor](http://www.jrsoftware.org/ispphelp/). Double-click `HackWindowsInstall.iss` (folder `src`), which will load it in Inno Setup and select *Build* - *Compile*.

We release the compiled installer with its SHA256 hash digest and [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/en/) malware scan report link in [Releases](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/releases/latest).


## Silent Installation

To install silently, use the following command:

 ``start /wait HackWindowsInstaller.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /CLOSEAPPLICATIONS /NORESTARTAPPLICATIONS``

To remove it silently:

 ``C:\Program Files\Hack Windows Installer\unins000.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART``


## Troubleshooting

The installer creates a log file on the path `C:\Users\(Username)\AppData\Local\Temp\Setup Log (Year-Month-Day) #XXX.txt`.

If you are using EMET: If the "Only trusted fonts" option is activated, you need to declare Hack as trusted or it will not be usable.


## Contributions

Any constructive contribution is very welcome! 

In order to fix a bug you have encountered, we require the log file from the installer. To view this log file, do the following:

- Click Start -> Click Run -> Enter *%temp%* to open your TEMP folder
- Locate the file called Setup Log 2016-04-26 #xxx.txt where XXX should be 001
- Double-click it and look into it to make sure it's the setup log from our installer. In the third line it should say *HackWindowsInstaller.exe*
- Check the file for any information that you do not want others to see. For example, line 3,4 and 10 contain the paths where the setup is started from and how your TEMP folder is called. Just delete these lines. The other lines should be safe and only contain common information.
- Open a new [issue](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/issues/new) in the Hack-Windows-Installer repository
- Paste the entire text (minus the lines noted above) there
